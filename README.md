k-Inductive and Interpolation Inspired Barrier Certificates for Stochastic Systems.

This repo contains the code for our paper:

1. M. A. Oumer, V. Murali, and M. Zamani, "k-Inductive and Interpolation-Inspired Barrier Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems".

If you install the TSSOS julia package in the code, please make these changes as a result of recent updates:
* Groebnerbasis needs to be updated to GroebnerBasis.
* For all the lines with `add_psatz!(...)`, change `model,_` to only `_`.
